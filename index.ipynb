    "## Introduction\n",
    "This module is based on a case study involving [WWII Japanese American incarceration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) archival records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). These records were examined for their potential to generate new forms of archival analysis and historical research engagement at the Tule Lake Unit, a recently established National Monument of the National Park Service (NPS) through a December 2008 Presidential proclamation. The project worked closely with NARA staff from the Office of Innovation and Research Services, and NPS staff from the NPS Tule Lake Unit, as well as prominent Tule Lake historians, colleagues from King’s College London, and experts from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n",

    "\n",
    "The overall aim of this project is to build a platform for the integration of a number of distributed digital sources including significant sources from NARA:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Camp “incident cards” data (persons, dates, events, locations)\n",
    "* Japanese-American Internee database of 109,000 names\n",
    "* 4,100 online WRA photos\n",
    "* Architectural camp records\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is inspired by the Digital Harlem Project, which developed a digital platform to query, map, and visualize legal records of ordinary citizens in Black Harlem between 1915 and 1930. The Tule Lake project investigates and prototypes a platform that also links people, places, and events from distributed sources in a way that brings that archive to life as a resource for investigation and storytelling.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Balancing privacy and  access is an important topic in the age of digital curation, where datafication and the use of big data can lead to compromising privacy through the application of predictive analytics. In this module, we use the 10,000 **released** cards to create and test an algorithm that detects personally identifiable information (PII). Since these cards are already released, those involving anyone who was a juvenile at the time have already been redacted by NARA staff. So this card data is ideal for use as a demonstration of the algorithmic techniques for PII identification.\n",

    "# Acquiring or Accessing the Data\n",
    "The data for this project was originally acquired from NARA collections and then screened to remove records related to those who were minors at the time. The main set of records is a subset of a larger collection of so called \"incident cards\" from the Tule Lake camp. The data also includes two datasets that are person registries. One is the \"FAR Registry\" and the other is the \"WRA Form 26 Register\". WRA is the War Relocation Authority. All data sources are included in this module as comma-separated values files. The links below will take you to a view of each data file:\n",
