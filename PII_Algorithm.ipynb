There are many, many ways to program this procedure in Python and some are more efficient and easier to understand than others. Generally a good first approach is to break the larger problem down into functional pieces and in computer science this practice is called **functional decomposition**. With our PII determination, the functional decomposition has already happened, in the form of our flowchart. We have identified two smaller \"name lookup\" processes within the larger procedure. One is to look up a name in the FAR registry and the other is to look up a name in WRA Form 26 records. Let's look more deeply at the \"name lookup\" process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper world a ordinary person would perform name lookups by looking at each record, in Form 26 for example, in turn until they either found a match with the incident card or reached the last record without a match. They would compare first and last names between the incident card and the paper record. If a last name doesn't match, then they can move on without also checking the first name. What we see here is that the \"name lookup\" procedure could have a flowchart as well, including a loop that checks each FAR record in turn against a given last name and then against a given first name. This is simple enough to implement in Pandas code."
